## ‚ú® Key Features

* **ü§ñ AI Conversational Assistant:** An intelligent and friendly chatbot that provides instant answers to pet care questions. It leverages a RAG pipeline to provide accurate information from a knowledge base and can search the web for general queries.
* **üìç Hyper-Local Service Directory:** A curated and searchable directory of pet services in Sri Lanka, including Vet Clinics, Groomers, Pet Shops, and Boarding facilities.
* **üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map View:** Service locations are plotted on an interactive Leaflet.js map, allowing users to easily visualize nearby options.
* **üîç Search & Filtering:** Users can search the directory by name and filter services by type (e.g., show only Vet Clinics), making it easy to find exactly what they need.
* **üí¨ Dynamic, Multi-Page Interface:** Built with React Router, providing a seamless multi-page experience for navigating between the chatbot and the service directory.

       |
       '------> [Python/FastAPI Chatbot API] <--> [Vector Store / LLM]
```

### Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * React.js
    * React Router
    * Axios
    * Leaflet.js (for maps)
    * CSS3

* **Backend (MERN):**
    * Node.js

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js installed ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/))
* Python installed ([https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/))
* Git installed ([https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/))
* A MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB installation.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL]
    cd PetCareSL
    ```

2.  **Setup the Chatbot API (Python):**
    * Navigate to the `chatbot-api` directory.
    * Create a `.env` file and add your API keys:
        ```env
        OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-or-your-openrouter-api-key"
        TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-your-tavily-api-key"
        ```
    * Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    * Run the API server:
        ```sh
        uvicorn main:app --reload
        ```
    The API will be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

3.  **Setup the Main Backend (Node.js):**
    * In a new terminal, navigate to the `backend` directory.
    * Create a `.env` file and add your MongoDB connection string:
        ```env
        MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
        ```
    * Install dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    * (Optional) Seed the database with sample data:
        ```sh
        node seeder/seeder.js
        ```
    * Run the server:
        ```sh
        node server.js
        ```
    The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

4.  **Setup the Frontend (React):**
    * In a third terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    * Install dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    * Run the React app:
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
